                I am a highly motivated and innovative Information Systems and Technology graduate, driven by a passion
                for continual learning and skill development. My academic journey includes a Bachelor's degree in
                Technical Exploitation of Aircraft and Engines, providing me with a solid foundation in engineering
                principles. Transitioning into software engineering and web development, I have honed my skills in
                building websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React. Additionally, my proficiency
                extends to mobile app development in Flutter, along with expertise in Java, Python, C++, and MATLAB.

            <p>
                With a strong entrepreneurial background, I bring excellent critical thinking and organizational skills
                to the table. My experience includes contributing to the development of a fully functional grocery app
                in Flutter and building websites using Bootstrap. I have a keen understanding of business models and
                have successfully executed technological ideas into tangible products through collaborative team
                projects. This dynamic blend of technical expertise and business acumen positions me as a valuable
                asset, ready to contribute to the success of any organization.

                In my professional journey, I have worked as a Mechatronic Engineer at ThermalR Industries, where I
                played a key role in developing a battery swapping system for electric vehicles. Currently, as a trainee
                software developer at Archmage Solutions, I am expanding my skills in software engineering. My practical
                experience, coupled with a proactive approach to problem-solving, aligns with my goal of effectively
                contributing to real-world problem-solving and organizational success in the field of technology.
